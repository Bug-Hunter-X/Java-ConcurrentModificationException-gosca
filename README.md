This repository demonstrates a common Java error: ConcurrentModificationException.  The example shows how to incorrectly modify a list while iterating using a for-each loop. A solution is provided that demonstrates a correct approach.  This issue occurs when you try to structurally modify a collection (like adding or removing elements) while simultaneously iterating over it using an iterator that doesn't support concurrent modification.
